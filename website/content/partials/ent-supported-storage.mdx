For enterprise customers, HashiCorp provides official support for Consul and Vault's Integrated Storage as storage backends. Vault Enterprise will
no longer startup if configured to use a storage backend other than Consul or Integrated Storage. This is meant to protect against issues caused by using
unsupported backends that do not support transactional storage.
