# Plugin System

All Vault auth methods and secrets engines are considered plugins. This concept
allows both built-in and external plugins to be treated like building blocks.
Any plugin can exist at multiple different mount paths. Different versions of a
plugin may be at each location, with each version differing from Vault's
version.

## Built-In Plugins

Built-in plugins are shipped with Vault, often for commonly used implementations,
and require no additional operator intervention to run. Built-in plugins are
just like any other backend code inside Vault.

To use a different or edited version of a built-in plugin, the plugin must be
run as an external plugin. See [Overriding Built-in Plugins](/docs/upgrading/plugins#overriding-built-in-plugins)
for details on how to override a built-in plugin in-place.

## External Plugins

External plugins are not shipped with Vault and require additional operator
intervention to run.

To run an external plugin, a binary of the plugin is required. Plugin
binaries can be obtained from [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/)
or they can be [built from source](/docs/plugins/plugin-development#building-a-plugin-from-source).

Vault's external plugins are completely separate, standalone applications that
Vault executes and communicates with over RPC. Each time a Vault secret engine
or auth method is mounted, a new process is spawned. However, plugins can be
made to implement [plugin multiplexing](/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-multiplexing)
to improve performance. Plugin multiplexing allows plugin processes to be
reused across all mounts of a given type.
